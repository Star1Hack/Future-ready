Issue 1:
Uses the technology of virtualisation i.e virtualisation separates tight coupling betweeen hardware and OS using an Abstraction layer called hypervisor. This hypervisor is able to enact all the services of a computer system. Microsoft has several data centers and these data centers conatins servers which contains hypervisors to run multiple VMs. Network switch connect all of these servers. Each server contains a rack to run a software called 'fabric controller'. And each fabric controller software is connected to software called oOrchestrator. The orcestrator is responsible for managing everything that happens in azure example: reponding to user requests Users(make request to create VM using web API of orchestrator i.e Azure portal) -> orchestrator processes the request > picks the best sever rack, packages and sends request to fabric controller. Once fabric contrallor creates a VM, user is connected to that VM to get its task done.
